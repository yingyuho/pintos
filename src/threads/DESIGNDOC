			 PRIORITY SCHEDULING
			 ===================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

New members in struct thread:
  struct list *locks; (list of locks currently held by thread)
  struct lock *bllock; (lock thread is blocked on)
  struct semaphore *blsema; (semaphore thread is blocked on)
  int cur_pri; (effective priority)
  
New member in struct lock:
  struct list_elem elem; (list element for the list in threads)

>> B2: Explain the data structure used to track priority donation.
>> Use ASCII art to diagram a nested donation.  (Alternately, submit a
>> .png file.)

Priority donation is tracked with an integer. ("structure"?)
Nested donation is also tracked with an integer; the cur_pri variable
is simply the largest appliable priority (i.e. of the thread itself
and all threads blocked on locks held by the thread). A sort of
implicit tree is formed by the held locks and threads blocked on them;
priority donation is done by donating to the "parent" of the thread
(i.e. the one holding the lock it's blocked on) and repeating if
that thread is also blocked to implement nested donation.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: How do you ensure that the highest priority thread waiting for
>> a lock, semaphore, or condition variable wakes up first?

The list of waiting threads in a semaphore is kept sorted by priority,
and when a thread is to be woken for a lock or semaphore it just picks
the one with highest priority. The list of semaphores for condition
variables is kept unsorted, but the list_get_min() function is used to
get the semaphore with the highest priority thread blocked on it.

>> B4: Describe the sequence of events when a call to lock_acquire()
>> causes a priority donation.  How is nested donation handled?

A priority donation is caused when the lock is already held by
another thread. If this is the case, then we check whether the thread
holding the lock has lower (effective) priority than the calling thread;
if so, we set that thread's priority to the calling thread's priority.
(All of this has to be done with interrupts disabled; otherwise the
we can end up donating priority to a thread that no longer holds the
lock) Nested donation is handled partly by iterating (if the thread 
holding the lock is also blocked on a lock, then we should donate to the
thread holding that lock and so on) and partly by donating the effective
priority (this removes the need to actually traverse any subtree).

>> B5: Describe the sequence of events when lock_release() is called
>> on a lock that a higher-priority thread is waiting for.

The lock_release code itself doesn't check for a higher priority
thread (the only change in it is to recalculate the effective priority
if necessary), but sema_up() calls maybe_yield(), which will yield if a
higher priority thread is now on the ready queue (i.e. if there was a
higher priority thread waiting on the lock).

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B6: Describe a potential race in thread_set_priority() and explain
>> how your implementation avoids it.  Can you use a lock to avoid
>> this race?

There is just one race condition possible, which is if the thread's
effective priority is modified between checking whether a lock's
priority is larger than effective priority and setting effective
priority to that lock's priority. It is avoided by disabling interrupts
for those two statements. (The case where it can happen is that we
are preempted by another thread with the same priority, which sets its own
priority higher and then donates to this thread and yields; this is kind
of contrived, but you could end up with priority inversion)
It could be avoided with a lock on the cur_pri variable, which would
cause more overhead.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B7: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>> another design you considered?

The locks and threads form a sort of implicit tree; priority donation is
conceptually handled via tree traversal. However, actual tree traversal
must be done with interrupts disabled to prevent race conditions, so we
don't actually want to do that. Instead, we can keep internal state
relating to subtrees, which can be updated due to assumptions we can make
about threads (they can't decrease priority while blocked, for example)

The main goal of the design was to eliminate tree traversal while 
maintaining as little additional state as possible. (As well as avoiding
expensive operations, like iterating over all threads) I found it necessary
to maintain a list of locks held by a thread (conceptually, the list of
children nodes) as well as the current effective priority (i.e. the maximum
priority of all threads in the subtree). The only place the tree is actually
worked with is lock_acquire() (and even then it only goes upward, so
complexity is limited by tree depth); the rest of the operations can be done
using just the additional state.

A useful invariant is that the priority of any thread is the
largest of its base priority and the effective priorities of the first
thread blocked on each lock held by it; this means we never need to
traverse downwards because we have all the necessary information about
each subtree, as long as they're updated correctly by lock_acquire().
Another is that only the root of a tree can be removed (all other threads
are blocked)
