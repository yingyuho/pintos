---- PRELIMINARIES ----

A lot of system calls should really have special treatment for directories,
especially because I'm abusing some of the variables. (read(), for example,
will have unexpected results in combination with readdir(), because pos
is set to the dir's pos rather than the file's for readdir())

                     INDEXED AND EXTENSIBLE FILES
                     ============================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

struct inode_disk {
  uint32_t sectors[126]; // array of sectors
    off_t length;   // file size in bytes
    unsigned magic; // used to identify directories
};

>> A2: What is the maximum size of a file supported by your inode
>> structure?  Show your work.

126 * 128 * 512B = 8257536 bytes

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A3: Explain how your code avoids a race if two processes attempt to
>> extend a file at the same time.

>> A4: Suppose processes A and B both have file F open, both
>> positioned at end-of-file.  If A reads and B writes F at the same
>> time, A may read all, part, or none of what B writes.  However, A
>> may not read data other than what B writes, e.g. if B writes
>> nonzero data, A is not allowed to see all zeros.  Explain how your
>> code avoids this race.

The length of the file is not updated until the write is finished; the
reader will not see any of what B writes.

>> A5: Explain how your synchronization design provides "fairness".
>> File access is "fair" if readers cannot indefinitely block writers
>> or vice versa.  That is, many processes reading from a file cannot

No blocking actually occurs between readers and writers.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A6: Is your inode structure a multilevel index?  If so, why did you
>> choose this particular combination of direct, indirect, and doubly
>> indirect blocks?  If not, why did you choose an alternative inode
>> structure, and what advantages and disadvantages does your
>> structure have, compared to a multilevel index?

It is a multilevel index; the combination was chosen for simplicity of
calculation and indexing. It has slightly more overhead than strictly
necessary.

                            SUBDIRECTORIES
                            ==============

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B2: Describe your code for traversing a user-specified path.  How
>> do traversals of absolute and relative paths differ?

A struct cur * keeps track of the directory during the traversal, and
strtok_r() is used to get the next part of the path. The traversal
of an absolute path starts at /, while the traversal of a relative
path starts at the process's current directory (however, this
distinction is made by the functions that do the traversal).

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B4: How do you prevent races on directory entries?  For example,
>> only one of two simultaneous attempts to remove a single file
>> should succeed, as should only one of two simultaneous attempts to
>> create a file with the same name, and so on.

>> B5: Does your implementation allow a directory to be removed if it
>> is open by a process or if it is in use as a process's current
>> working directory?  If so, what happens to that process's future
>> file system operations?  If not, how do you prevent it?

Yes; the relevant directory calls simply fail if the underlying inode
has been removed.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B6: Explain why you chose to represent the current directory of a
>> process the way you did.

It's represented as a pointer to a struct dir, making it easy to update
and take up relatively little memory.

                             BUFFER CACHE
                             ============

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> C1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> C2: Describe how your cache replacement algorithm chooses a cache
>> block to evict.

>> C3: Describe your implementation of write-behind.

>> C4: Describe your implementation of read-ahead.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> C5: When one process is actively reading or writing data in a
>> buffer cache block, how are other processes prevented from evicting
>> that block?

>> C6: During the eviction of a block from the cache, how are other
>> processes prevented from attempting to access the block?

---- RATIONALE ----

>> C7: Describe a file workload likely to benefit from buffer caching,
>> and workloads likely to benefit from read-ahead and write-behind.
